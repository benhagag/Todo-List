Hello Everyone,

Please set up this project in your server php locally (Wamp, Xamp, Mamp).

The SQL file is going to be found in the "back" folder so you can import this to your data base.

In File DB.php you can adjust the credentials and the db name for your database.

Pay attention that the path of the project is match to the url which I made request to. if it is not, just change the varible urlApi in index.js file to the right url.
